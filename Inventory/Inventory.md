# Inventory System

## Introduction

---

The inventory system can be broken down into two component

* The ItemFactory class - responsible for creating the item instances in the game.
* The InventoryManager - responsible for tracking what items the player has

The workflow essentially has two paths:

1. Item Scriptable object assigned to a Bootstrapper is used by the ItemFactory to instantiate a new item
2. Item is already in the Scene, it self-registers with the ItemFactory and receives a Unique ID from it
